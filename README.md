Kingâ€™s Call â€“ A Strategic Card Game
Developed as part of the "It's In The Game" project course

About the Game:
Kingâ€™s Call is a strategic card game designed for four players, played in teams of two. The goal is simple. The first team to win seven rounds, claims victory.

Genre & Setting:
Set in a fantasy world, Kingâ€™s Call combines classic card game mechanics with immersive storytelling and strategic gameplay.

What Makes It Unique?
The game is inspired by the traditional Persian card game Hokm, but weâ€™ve added a fresh storyline, new rules, and exciting twists to make it even more engaging and competitive. Our unique approach brings a modern and thrilling experience while honoring the roots of the original game.

This project was a fantastic opportunity to blend tradition with innovation, and Iâ€™m proud of what my teammates and I created! ðŸš€ðŸŽ®
